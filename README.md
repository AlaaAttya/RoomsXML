# RoomsXML
PHP library for RoomsXML integration

# What's RoomsXML? 
 Is an accommodation distribution system designed for travel companies. The point of difference with roomsXML is in its proprietary software capability to flawlessly map and de-duplicate the inventory that comes from many destination specific suppliers, direct contracting and dynamically from large hotel chains.
